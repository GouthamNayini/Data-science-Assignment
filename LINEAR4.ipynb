    "Q1. What is Lasso Regression, and how does it differ from other regression techniques?\n",
    "\n",
    "Lasso Regression, also known as Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO), is a powerful statistical technique that shines in both regression analysis and feature selection. Here's the essence:\n",
    "\n",
    "Objective: Like other regression methods, it aims to model the relationship between a target variable (what you want to predict) and independent variables (your predictors).\n",
    "Uniqueness: Unlike its peers, it applies an L1 penalty (sum of absolute values) to the coefficients of the regression model. This penalty essentially \"shrinks\" some coefficients towards zero, potentially even setting them to zero completely.\n",
    "Key Differences:\n",
    "\n",
    "Regularization: L1 penalty in Lasso vs. L2 penalty in Ridge Regression. L1 encourages sparsity (fewer non-zero coefficients), leading to feature selection. L2 keeps all coefficients non-zero but shrinks them, reducing variance.\n",
    "Feature Selection: Lasso automatically selects important features by driving less relevant ones to zero, offering interpretability. Other techniques like stepwise regression require manual selection.\n",
    "Overfitting: Both Lasso and Ridge combat overfitting (model memorizing noise) by penalizing complexity, but Lasso can be more effective with many correlated features."

    "Q2. What is the main advantage of using Lasso Regression in feature selection?\n",
    "\n",
    "The primary advantage of Lasso Regression in feature selection is its automatic and data-driven approach. While manual selection methods require expert knowledge and can be subjective, Lasso objectively identifies the most relevant features based on their contribution to the model's accuracy. This offers:\n",
    "\n",
    "Interpretability: A simpler model with fewer features is easier to understand and explain.\n",
    "Reduced Overfitting: Focuses on important features, reducing the risk of the model learning meaningless patterns from noise.\n",
    "Enhanced Prediction: By selecting the most informative features, Lasso can sometimes lead to better prediction accuracy compared to models using all features."

    "\n",

    "\n",
    "Magnitude: Larger absolute values indicate stronger relationships between the corresponding feature and the target variable.\n",
    "Sign: Positive coefficients suggest a positive impact on the target, while negative ones imply a negative impact.\n",
    "Comparison to Zero: Remember, some coefficients in Lasso may be driven to zero, meaning those features have no predictive power in the model."

    "Q4. What are the tuning parameters that can be adjusted in Lasso Regression, and how do they affect the model's performance?\n",
    "\n",
    "Lasso Regression primarily has one key tuning parameter:\n",
    "\n",
    "λ (Lambda): This controls the strength of the L1 penalty. Higher λ values lead to more aggressive shrinkage, potentially driving more coefficients to zero and creating a sparser model.\n",
    "Effects on Performance:\n",
    "\n",
    "Bias-Variance Trade-off:\n",
    "High λ: Reduces variance (complexity) at the cost of introducing bias (underfitting), as important features might be excluded.\n",
    "Low λ: Decreases bias but increases variance (overfitting), including more irrelevant features. Finding the optimal λ balances these aspects.\n",
    "Feature Selection: Higher λ often results in fewer non-zero coefficients, aiding feature selection but potentially losing informative ones.\n",
    "Prediction Accuracy: There's an optimal λ that maximizes prediction accuracy, usually found through cross-validation techniques like k-fold.\n",
    "Methods for Tuning λ:\n",

    "K-Fold Cross-Validation: Evaluate the model's performance on different subsets of the data with various λ values, choosing the λ that minimizes a chosen metric (e.g., mean squared error).\n",

    "Q5. Can Lasso Regression be used for non-linear regression problems? If yes, how?\n",
    "\n",
    "Directly: No, Lasso Regression assumes a linear relationship between features and the target variable. It won't capture non-linear relationships effectively.\n",
    "Indirectly: You can create new features using polynomial terms, interactions, or other feature engineering techniques to capture non-linearity. Then, apply Lasso Regression to the transformed data. This requires careful feature selection and domain knowledge to avoid creating redundant or irrelevant features.\n",
    "Alternatives: Consider non-linear regression methods like Support Vector Regression (SVR) or decision trees when the relationship between features and the target is inherently non-linear."

    "\n",
    "Lasso Regression can partially handle multicollinearity, but it's crucial to understand its limitations and approach it cautiously. Here's the nuanced truth:\n",
    "\n",
    "Partial Handling:\n",
    "\n",
    "Feature Elimination: When features are highly correlated, Lasso tends to select only one of them, essentially removing the redundant information. This can reduce the impact of multicollinearity on coefficient estimates and model stability.\n",
    "Limitations:\n",
    "\n",
    "Arbitrary Selection: If multiple collinear features have similar predictive power, Lasso might arbitrarily choose one, leading to instability and potentially inaccurate interpretations.\n",
    "Performance Impact: Severe multicollinearity can still affect Lasso's performance, potentially increasing bias and decreasing prediction accuracy.\n",
    "Recommendations:\n",
    "\n",
    "Assess Multicollinearity: Check for high correlations between features using metrics like Variance Inflation Factor (VIF).\n",
    "Moderate Multicollinearity: If it's mild, Lasso can be a good option, but carefully interpret results, considering potential instability.\n",
    "Severe Multicollinearity: Consider alternative approaches like:\n",
    "Preprocessing: Combine or remove highly correlated features.\n",
    "Ridge Regression: More stable in multicollinearity but doesn't offer direct feature selection.\n",
    "Principal Component Analysis (PCA): Reduce dimensionality by capturing essential variation in the data."
