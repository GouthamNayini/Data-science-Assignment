    "Q1. Describe the decision tree classifier algorithm and how it works to make predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "A decision tree classifier is a machine learning algorithm that works by splitting the data into subsets based on features (attributes) until reaching leaf nodes representing class labels. Here's the basic flow:\n",
    "\n",
    "Start with the root node: This node represents the entire dataset.\n",
    "Choose the best splitting feature: This feature provides the best separation between different classes based on an impurity measure (e.g., Gini index for entropy).\n",
    "Split the data based on the feature values: Each branch represents a possible value of the chosen feature.\n",
    "Repeat steps 2-3 for each split: Create new nodes, further splitting the data until reaching a stopping criterion (e.g., maximum depth, minimum purity level).\n",
    "Predict: New data instances follow the branches based on their feature values, reaching a leaf node that represents the predicted class label.\n",

    "\n",
    "While decision trees appear simple, they use several mathematical concepts:\n",
    "\n",
    "Impurity measures: Gini index or information gain quantifies how mixed the classes are at a node. A higher score indicates higher impurity, and the feature that reduces impurity the most becomes the splitting criterion.\n",
    "Entropy: Information theory concept measuring the uncertainty associated with a random variable (representing class labels in this case). Entropy reduction guides the branching process.\n",
    "Information gain: The difference in entropy between a parent node and its child nodes, indicating how much new information the chosen split provides for classification."

    "\n",
    "For binary classification (two classes), the chosen splitting feature at each node will create two branches, separating instances belonging to each class (positive/negative). This process continues until each leaf node contains only instances of one class, representing the prediction for new data points.\n"

    "\n",
    "Decision trees can be seen as creating hyperplanes or decision boundaries in the feature space. Each split creates a new hyperplane, dividing the data based on feature values. New data points are classified by traversing these hyperplanes until reaching a leaf node, essentially finding the region in the feature space where they belong."
