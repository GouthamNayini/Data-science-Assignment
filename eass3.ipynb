    "Q1. What is Random Forest Regressor?\n",
    "\n",
    "A Random Forest Regressor is a machine learning algorithm that belongs to the ensemble learning category. It combines multiple decision trees to predict continuous target values (regression tasks). Each individual tree is trained on a subset of the data and using a random subset of features at each split. The final prediction is made by averaging the predictions from all the trees in the forest."

    "\n",
    "Random Forest Regressors help reduce the risk of overfitting in two ways:\n",
    "\n",
    "Bagging: They use bagging (bootstrap aggregating), where only a random subset of the data is used to train each individual tree. This introduces diversity among the trees, preventing them from memorizing the training data and improving generalization to unseen data.\n",
    "Feature randomness: During each split in a decision tree, only a random subset of features is considered for splitting. This further prevents overfitting by preventing any single tree from relying too heavily on specific features."

    "The output of a Random Forest Regressor is a continuous numerical value.\n",
    "\n",
    "In a Random Forest Regressor, each decision tree in the ensemble predicts a continuous value for the target variable. During prediction, the final output of the Random Forest Regressor is obtained by averaging the predictions of all individual decision trees in the ensemble. This averaging process helps to smooth out individual tree predictions and produce a more robust and accurate prediction for regression tasks. Therefore, the output of a Random Forest Regressor is a single continuous value, representing the predicted value of the target variable for a given set of input features."

    "In a regression task, the goal is to predict a continuous numerical value. Random Forest Regressor works by constructing an ensemble of decision trees, where each tree predicts a continuous value, and the final prediction is obtained by averaging the predictions of all trees.\n",
    "\n",
    "For classification tasks, where the goal is to predict a categorical label or class, you would typically use Random Forest Classifier instead. Random Forest Classifier works similarly to the regressor but is tailored for classification tasks. It constructs an ensemble of decision trees, where each tree predicts the class label, and the final prediction is determined by majority voting among the predictions of all trees in the ensemble."
