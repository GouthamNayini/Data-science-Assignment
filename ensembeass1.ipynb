    "Q1. What is an ensemble technique in machine learning?\n",
    "\n",
    "An ensemble technique is a methodology in machine learning that combines multiple models to improve the overall predictive performance compared to using a single model. It leverages the collective strength of individual models to create a more robust and accurate predictor.\n",

    "Sample with replacement: Draw a sample of the same size as the original data with replacement from the original data. This means a data point can be selected multiple times in the same sample.\n",

    "\n",
    "Ensemble techniques are used for several reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "Improved accuracy and generalization: By combining diverse models, they can reduce the bias and variance of individual models, leading to better performance and generalization on unseen data.\n",
    "Robustness and stability: Ensemble methods are less susceptible to overfitting and can be more robust to noise and outliers in the data compared to single models.\n",
    "Leveraging different learning approaches: Combining models trained with different algorithms or settings can capture diverse perspectives and potentially overcome limitations of individual models."

    "\n",
    "Bagging, short for bootstrap aggregating, is an ensemble technique where multiple models are trained independently on random subsets of the original data with replacement (i.e., data points can be included multiple times). The final prediction is made by aggregating the predictions of individual models, typically through averaging (for regression) or voting (for classification).\n"

    "Boosting is another ensemble technique where models are trained sequentially. Each new model learns from the errors of the previous model. The model focuses on correcting the misclassified instances by the previous models, aiming to improve the overall performance iteratively. Examples of boosting algorithms include AdaBoost and XGBoost.\n"
