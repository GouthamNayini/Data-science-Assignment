    " Q1. What is the Filter method in feature selection, and how does it work?\n",
    "\n",
    "The Filter method is a feature selection technique that evaluates the intrinsic characteristics of features without involving any machine learning algorithms. It works by ranking or scoring each feature based on some statistical measure or heuristic, and then selecting the top-ranked features for the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Common techniques used in the Filter method include correlation coefficient, chi-square test, information gain, and mutual information. These techniques assess the relevance of features to the target variable or their ability to provide unique information."

    "Q2. How does the Wrapper method differ from the Filter method in feature selection?\n",
    "\n",
    "The Wrapper method differs from the Filter method in that it evaluates feature subsets using a specific machine learning algorithm. It iteratively selects subsets of features, trains a model on each subset, and evaluates their performance based on a predefined metric (e.g., accuracy, F1-score). This process is computationally intensive but can provide more accurate feature subsets tailored to the predictive model."
