    " Nominal encoding, also known as label encoding, is a technique used to convert categorical variables into numerical representations, where each category is assigned a unique integer value. For example, if we have a categorical variable \"City\" with values \"New York,\" \"London,\" and \"Paris,\" we can assign integer values like 0, 1, and 2, respectively.\n",

One practical example is when encoding ordinal variables like \"Low,\" \"Medium,\" and \"High,\" where the order matters, and representing them as numerical values would preserve that order."

One-hot encoding is suitable in this scenario because each category within the categorical variables is distinct and does not imply an ordinal relationship. Additionally, one-hot encoding ensures that the encoded features are binary and does not impose any arbitrary ordering on the categories, making it appropriate for machine learning algorithms."
