    "address this issue?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Multicollinearity in multiple linear regression occurs when two or more independent variables in the model are highly correlated with each other. This can cause issues in the regression analysis because it becomes difficult to separate the individual effects of each independent variable on the dependent variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a breakdown of the concept and its implications:\n",
    "\n",
    "Concept of Multicollinearity:\n",
    "\n",
    "Multicollinearity occurs when there is a strong linear relationship between independent variables in the regression model.\n",
    "It does not directly affect the predictive ability of the model but can lead to unreliable estimates of the coefficients and inflated standard errors.\n",
    "Multicollinearity can make it challenging to interpret the individual effects of each independent variable on the dependent variable.\n",
    "It can also cause instability in the coefficient estimates, making them sensitive to small changes in the data.\n",
    "Detection of Multicollinearity:\n",
    "\n",
    "One common way to detect multicollinearity is by calculating the correlation matrix between independent variables. Correlation values close to ±1 indicate high collinearity.\n",
    "Variance Inflation Factor (VIF) is another useful metric for detecting multicollinearity. VIF measures how much the variance of a coefficient is inflated due to multicollinearity. A VIF greater than 5 or 10 is often considered indicative of multicollinearity.\n",
    "Additionally, graphical methods such as scatterplots or heatmaps can help visualize the relationships between independent variables.\n",
    "Addressing Multicollinearity:\n",
    "\n",
    "Remove one or more of the highly correlated independent variables from the model. This approach is feasible if the variables are redundant or theoretically similar.\n",
    "Combine the correlated independent variables into a single composite variable. For example, if two variables measure similar aspects of the same concept, you could create a weighted average or sum of the two.\n",
    "Use regularization techniques such as ridge regression or LASSO regression, which penalize large coefficient estimates and can help mitigate the effects of multicollinearity.\n",
    "Collect more data if possible to reduce the impact of multicollinearity. Increasing the sample size can sometimes mitigate multicollinearity issues.\n",
    "Finally, if multicollinearity is present but not severe, you may choose to proceed with caution and interpret the coefficients with awareness of the potential bias and instability introduced by multicollinearity."

    "Q7. Describe the polynomial regression model. How is it different from linear regression?\n",
    "\n",
    "Polynomial regression is a type of regression analysis where the relationship between the independent variable (or variables) and the dependent variable is modeled as an nth-degree polynomial. This means that instead of fitting a straight line (as in linear regression), polynomial regression fits a curve to the data.\n",

    "Interpretability:\n",

    "Risk of Overfitting:\n",
