    "\n",
    "ROC curve (Receiver Operating Characteristic): Plots the true positive rate (TPR) against the false positive rate (FPR) at different classification thresholds. It shows the trade-off between correctly identifying positives and incorrectly classifying negatives.\n",
    "AUC (Area Under the ROC Curve): Represents the total area under the ROC curve, ranging from 0.5 (random guessing) to 1 (perfect classification). Higher AUC indicates better overall performance across different thresholds.\n",
    "ROC and AUC are particularly useful for:\n",
    "\n",
    "Imbalanced classes: When one class is much larger than the other, they provide a more robust evaluation than accuracy.\n",
    "Threshold-based models: When choosing a classification threshold is important, the ROC curve helps visualize the impact on true and false positives."
