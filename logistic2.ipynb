    "\n",
    "Purpose: Grid search cross-validation (GS CV) is a hyperparameter tuning technique that exhaustively evaluates a range of possible values for multiple hyperparameters. It aims to find the combination that optimizes a specified performance metric.\n",
    "\n",
    "How it works:\n",
    "\n",
    "Define hyperparameter grid: Specify the hyperparameters you want to tune and their possible values.\n",
    "Perform cross-validation: Split your data into k folds. For each fold:\n",
    "Fit the model with every combination of hyperparameter values.\n",
    "Evaluate the model's performance on the remaining folds (e.g., using accuracy, F1-score, AUC-ROC).\n",
    "Choose the best combination: Select the combination of hyperparameters that yields the best average performance across all folds."

    "Exhaustive: Tries all possible combinations of hyperparameter values within the defined grid.\n",

    "Stochastic: Samples random combinations of hyperparameter values from the defined ranges.\n",
    "Faster than grid search: More efficient for large grids or many hyperparameters.\n",
