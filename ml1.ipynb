    "Definition: Artificial Intelligence refers to the development of computer systems that can perform tasks that typically require human intelligence. These tasks include learning, reasoning, problem-solving, perception, and language understanding.\n",
    "Scope: AI can be categorized into two main types: Narrow AI (or Weak AI), which is designed to perform a specific task, and General AI (or Strong AI), which would have the ability to understand, learn, and apply knowledge across a wide range of tasks as a human does.\n",
    "\n",
    "Machine Learning (ML):\n",
    "Definition: Machine Learning is a subset of AI that focuses on the development of algorithms and statistical models that enable computers to perform tasks without being explicitly programmed. It involves the use of data to train a model, allowing the system to make predictions or decisions based on new, unseen data.\n",
    "Key Concepts:\n",
    "Training Data: ML models learn from labeled data, where the algorithm is exposed to input-output pairs to learn the patterns and relationships.\n",
    "Features and Labels: Features are the input variables, and labels are the output variable that the model aims to predict.\n",
    "Types of ML: ML can be categorized into three main types: Supervised Learning, Unsupervised Learning, and Reinforcement Learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "Deep Learning:\n",
    "Definition: Deep Learning is a subset of Machine Learning that involves neural networks with multiple layers (deep neural networks). These neural networks are capable of learning and representing intricate patterns and hierarchical features from data.\n",
    "Key Concepts:\n",
    "Neural Networks: Deep Learning models are typically composed of artificial neural networks inspired by the structure and function of the human brain.\n",
    "Layers: Deep neural networks consist of an input layer, multiple hidden layers, and an output layer. The hidden layers allow for the learning of complex representations.\n",
    "Training: Deep Learning models require a large amount of labeled data for training, and the training process involves adjusting the weights and biases of the network to minimize the difference between predicted and actual outputs.\n",
    "Applications: Deep Learning has been particularly successful in tasks such as image and speech recognition, natural language processing, and playing strategic games like Go."
