    "Bias: Bias refers to the underfitting of a model. A high-bias model makes overly simplified assumptions about the data, leading to systematic errors and an inability to capture the true underlying patterns. Imagine you have a simple linear model trying to fit a complex, non-linear dataset. The model will likely have high bias, underestimating the true relationship and consistently missing the mark.\n",

    "Q7: What is regularization in machine learning, and how can it be used to prevent overfitting? Describe\n",
    "some common regularization techniques and how they work.\n",
    "\n",
    "Regularization is a powerful technique in machine learning that helps prevent overfitting. Overfitting occurs when a model learns the training data so well that it captures not only the true underlying patterns but also the random noise, leading to poor performance on unseen data. Regularization acts as a safeguard against this, encouraging the model to learn generalizable patterns and reducing its sensitivity to noise.\n",
    "\n",
    "How Regularization Works:\n",
    "\n",
    "Regularization typically penalizes complex models with many parameters, pushing them towards simpler models with fewer degrees of freedom. This penalty term is added to the model's objective function, influencing the learning process and ultimately driving the model towards better generalization.\n",
    "\n",
    "Common Regularization Techniques:\n",
    "\n",
    "L1 Regularization (LASSO): This technique adds the L1 norm (sum of absolute values) of the model's weights to the objective function. The L1 norm acts like a filter, shrinking small weights towards zero, effectively removing them from the model. This leads to a sparse model with fewer non-zero weights, reducing its complexity and preventing overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "L2 Regularization (Ridge Regression): This technique adds the L2 norm (sum of squared values) of the model's weights to the objective function. The L2 norm penalizes large weights more heavily than small ones, encouraging the model to distribute its weights more evenly. This reduces the impact of individual features and promotes smoother decision boundaries, making the model less sensitive to noise.\n",
    "\n",
    "Elastic Net: This technique combines L1 and L2 regularization, offering the benefits of both. It shrinks small weights like L1 but also encourages even weight distribution like L2, leading to potentially sparser models compared to pure L2 regularization.\n",
    "\n",
    "Early Stopping: This technique monitors the model's performance on a validation set during training. If the performance on the validation set starts to decrease, indicating overfitting on the training data, training is stopped. This prevents the model from memorizing noise and improves its ability to generalize to unseen data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Dropout: This technique randomly drops out a certain percentage of neurons in a neural network during training. This forces the network to learn a more robust representation of the data that is not reliant on any specific set of neurons, preventing overfitting and improving generalization."
