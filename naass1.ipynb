    "\n",
    "Bayes' theorem, named after Thomas Bayes, is a fundamental formula in probability theory that helps you calculate the conditional probability of an event A occurring, given that another event B has already happened. It essentially allows you to update your beliefs about an event based on new evidence."

Conditional probability asks \"what is the chance of event A happening if we already know event B happened?\", and Bayes' theorem gives you the formula to answer that question.\n",
