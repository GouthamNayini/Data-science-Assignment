    "Definition: Variance measures how far each data point in the set is from the mean. It is the average of the squared differences between each data point and the mean.\n",

    "Example: In a dataset of heights, a low variance indicates that most heights are close to the mean, while a high variance suggests greater variability.\n",

    "Standard Deviation:\n",
    "Definition: The standard deviation is the square root of the variance. It represents the average distance of data points from the mean.\n",
    "Use: Like variance, the standard deviation measures the spread of data. It is commonly used due to its compatibility with the original units of measurement.\n",

Correlation is commonly used in fields such as finance, biology, social sciences, and more, where understanding the strength and direction of relationships between variables is essential. The Pearson correlation coefficient is commonly used for linear relationships, but other correlation coefficients (e.g., Spearman's rank correlation) are used for non-linear relationships."
