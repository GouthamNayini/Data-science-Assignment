    "The Central Limit Theorem is a fundamental concept in statistics that describes the shape of the distribution of the sample mean  for a sufficiently large sample size, regardless of the shape of the population distribution. It states that, as the sample size increases, the distribution of the sample mean approaches a normal distribution, even if the original population distribution is not normal.\n",

    "Inference and Hypothesis Testing:\n",
    "\n",
    "It forms the basis for making inferences about population parameters and conducting hypothesis tests. With a sufficiently large sample size, the sample mean can be treated as normally distributed, and statistical tests relying on normality assumptions can be applied.\n",
    "Sampling Distribution Understanding:\n",
    "\n",
    "The CLT helps in understanding the properties of the sampling distribution of the sample mean. It provides insights into how sample means behave and how their distribution becomes more normal as the sample size increases.\n",
