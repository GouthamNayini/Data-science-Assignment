    "On the other hand, while R-squared (R2) is a useful metric for understanding the proportion of variance explained by the model, it doesn't directly penalize the model for prediction errors in the same way MSE does.

    "\n",
    "When dealing with a dataset that contains a significant number of outliers, it's important to choose a regression metric that is robust to outliers. Outliers can heavily influence metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), leading to skewed evaluations of the model's performance. In such cases, metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE) would be more appropriate because it is less sensitive to outliers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mean Absolute Error (MAE) measures the average absolute differences between the predicted and actual values. Since it takes the absolute differences, outliers have less impact on the overall error calculation compared to MSE or RMSE, making it more robust in the presence of outliers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, if you have a dataset with a significant number of outliers and you're using an SVM regression model, it's advisable to use Mean Absolute Error (MAE) as your regression metric for evaluation. This will provide a more reliable assessment of your model's performance while mitigating the influence of outliers."

    "When you have calculated both Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) and found that both values are very close, it suggests that the scale of the errors is consistent across your dataset. This similarity between MSE and RMSE is expected because RMSE is simply the square root of MSE, so they are directly related.\n",
    "\n",
    "In such cases, it's generally preferable to use RMSE as the evaluation metric. The reason is that RMSE has the advantage of being in the same units as the target variable, which can make it more interpretable. Additionally, since RMSE penalizes larger errors more heavily due to the square root operation, it provides a better representation of the average magnitude of the errors.\n",
