    "Q1. What is Web Scraping? Why is it Used? Give three areas where Web Scraping is used to get data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Web Scraping is a technique used to extract data from websites. It involves fetching web pages, parsing the HTML or other markup languages, and extracting the desired information. Web scraping is used when the required data is not available through APIs or other structured means. It's often employed for various purposes, including:\n",
    "\n",
    "Data Extraction for Research: Researchers may use web scraping to collect data for academic or market research. This can include gathering information on trends, sentiments, or statistics.\n",
    "\n",
    "Competitor Analysis: Businesses often use web scraping to monitor their competitors' prices, product offerings, and other relevant data to stay competitive in the market.\n",
    "\n",
    "Content Aggregation: Websites and apps that aggregate content from various sources may use web scraping to collect and display relevant information from multiple sites."

    "Q2. What are the different methods used for Web Scraping?\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several methods for web scraping, and the choice depends on the project requirements and the structure of the target website. Some common methods include:\n",
    "\n",
    "Manual Copy-Pasting: Suitable for small-scale tasks, where the amount of data to be collected is minimal. It involves manually copying and pasting information.\n",
    "\n",
    "Regular Expressions (Regex): Regex can be used to search and match patterns in the HTML code, allowing for extraction of specific data.\n",
    "\n",
    "HTML Parsing: Parsing HTML using libraries like Beautiful Soup allows developers to navigate and extract data from the HTML structure of a webpage.\n",
    "\n",
    "XPath: XPath is a language used to navigate XML documents, including HTML. It provides a powerful way to select elements on a webpage for scraping.\n",
    "\n",
    "CSS Selectors: Similar to XPath, CSS selectors help identify and extract HTML elements. They are often used in conjunction with libraries like Beautiful Soup.\n",
    "\n",
    "Web Scraping Libraries: Python libraries such as Scrapy and Beautiful Soup are popular for web scraping. They provide tools for making HTTP requests, parsing HTML, and extracting data."

    "Q3. What is Beautiful Soup? Why is it used?\n",
    "\n",
    "Beautiful Soup is a Python library for pulling data out of HTML and XML files. It provides Pythonic idioms for iterating, searching, and modifying the parse tree. Beautiful Soup sits on top of popular Python parsers like lxml and html5lib, allowing it to navigate and search the parse tree in a Pythonic way.\n",

    "\n",
    "Parse HTML: Beautiful Soup helps in parsing HTML or XML documents and creates a parse tree for traversal.\n",
    "\n",
    "Search and Navigate: It provides methods and attributes for searching and navigating the parse tree, making it easy to extract the required data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Filter and Modify: Beautiful Soup allows developers to filter data based on specific conditions and modify the parse tree if necessary."

    "Q4. Why is Flask used in this Web Scraping project?\n",
    "\n",
    "Flask is a lightweight web application framework for Python. It is often used in web scraping projects for the following reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "Web Interface: Flask allows you to create a web interface for your web scraping application. This is useful for interacting with users, displaying results, and providing a user-friendly experience.\n",
    "\n",
    "RESTful APIs: Flask can be used to create RESTful APIs that expose the scraped data, allowing other applications or services to consume the data programmatically.\n",
    "\n",
    "Integration with Frontend: If you want to create a web-based dashboard or visualization for the scraped data, Flask can serve as the backend, handling data processing and communication with the frontend.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ease of Use: Flask is known for its simplicity and ease of use, making it a good choice for small to medium-sized web scraping projects where a full-fledged web framework might be overkill."
